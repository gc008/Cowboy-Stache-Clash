    <p>A Cowboy from the West and a Cowboy from the East,
    <p>Both with mustaches thoroughly greased,</p>
    <p>The Cowboy from the West always professed</p>
    <p>That his mustache was better than the rest.</p>
    <p>The Cowboy from the East hopped off his great beast,</p>
    <p>And stated his mustache was blessed by a priest.</p>
    <p>The Cowboy on the left who came from the West</p>
    <p>Stood across from the Cowboy from the East,</p>
    <p>Whose mustache was just creased</p>
    <p>Said, “Walk forward 3 paces,</p>
    <p>So we can see each other’s faces.”</p>
    <p>The Cowboy on the right was always polite,</p>
    <p>But now ready to fight.</p>
    <p>He then made a quick bow, then said with a vow,</p>
    <p>“The next move is up to you now.”</p>
    <p>The Cowboy from the West accepted the request</p>
    <p>Then took out his gun, and aimed it at the other man’s chest.</p>
    <p>They both stood perspiring,</p>
    <p>And then started firing,</p>
    <p>Each one both hit,</p>
    <p>Slowly began to sit,</p>
    <p>Then held their own gashes,</p>
    <p>And admired each other’s 'staches.</p>
    <p>They both felt they won,</p>
    <p>Then stared toward the sun.</p>
    <p>Their duel was now done.</p>
